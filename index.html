            <p>Hello! I'm Image, a passionate and dedicated graduate student pursuing a PhD in Computer Science. With a strong foundation in theoretical concepts, and a deep interest in practical implementation, I specialize in cybersecurity and machine learning.</p>
            <p>My journey in Computer Science began with my undergrad degree in Information Technology Enginnering, where I first discovered my passion for coding and problem solving. This passion led me to pursue a PhD at Oklahoma State University, where I am currently involved in data privacy, and security. </p>
            <p>I thrive on challenges, and am always eager to learn and adapt to solve real world problems. I'm excited to share my journey and projects that I've worked on through this portfolio. Please feel free to explore my work, and reach out to me for possible collaborations or opportunities.</p>
